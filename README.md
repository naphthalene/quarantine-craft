# Quarantine Craft Website

Lots of interesting information about MMO stats and what not can be
exposed as a graphical UI. This repo contains the single-page frontend
app as well as a periodic script to dump stats into a JSON blob.

## Development

    git submodule update --init --recursive

Deployment code lives in `ansible/`
Scripts in `bin/`
